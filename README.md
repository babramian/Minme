# Base-62-Converter
***WRITTEN IN PYTHON***
Python program that contains two methods, one of which converts base 10 integers to base 62 numerals, and another which does the opposite.

CONTAINS:
One test file (Base_62_Converter_Test.py), which tests the program.
Main program file (Base_62_Converter).

RUN INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Clone this repository, make sure you remember what directory you've cloned it to

2) Go into the directory you've downloaded the files to, create a text file and rename it '__init__.py'. This is to allow the files to interact with each other.

3) Open your command prompt, this can be done by pressing the Windows key and typing 'cmd'

4) Traverse into the directory you've downlaoded the files into

5) Type 'python Base_62_Converter_Test.py' and press Enter

The test program shall print encoded Base 62 numbers into your prompt, followed by those same numbers decoded into Base 10 integers.
